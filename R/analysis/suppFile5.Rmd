##Supplementary file 5. Variants Clustered on the Myosin Mesa

**_Table S5 - Assessing the enrichment of HCM and DCM-causing variants on the mesa._** The mesa is defined as the `r length(homburgerSurface %in% interactions$aaPos)` residue surface observed in the pre-stroke state, as reported in {Homburger, 2016 #43}, which represents `r signif(length(homburgerSurface %in% interactions$aaPos)/1935,2)`% of the MYH7 protein.  The proportion of HCM & DCM causing variants that fall on the mesa surface is shown, and compared with the expected proportion using the binomial test. Full variant details are shown in Tables 1-3 (in the main text).
